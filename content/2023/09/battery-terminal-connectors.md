The battery terminal connectors on the loco were a little bit worse for wear, they were rusty and hadn't been cleaned up for a while. One of the jobs I wanted to do before starting the loco was clean them.

At first, a new set were machined however these were the wrong size.

As the person who had machined them was away I set about cleaning up the existing bolts with a wire brush, these were then sprayed and hardened in the oven to give a final finish.

They turned out pretty good I think, however I still thing that the entire terminal connector needs to be replaced, it is rather bulky and there is way too much metal on show, however that is a job for another day.
