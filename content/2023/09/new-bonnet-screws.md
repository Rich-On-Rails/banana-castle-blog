The Bonnet screws that came manufacturer fitted are really fiddly, they are hard to take off and even harder to put back on, reason for this is that they are so small, getting your fingers around them and then not dropping them when the screw comes fully out of the thread is tricky.

I opted to replace them, sourced for M4 thumb screws off the internet, they are silver in colour which is different to the body of the loco.

However, when fitted they look great.

Much easier to remove now too, can easily get your finger and thumb around it to take them off without fear of loosing them in the gravel or grass.
