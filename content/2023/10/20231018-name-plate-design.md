Today I spent a bit of time getting used to some basic 3D modelling software called [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) designing a name plate for the side of the bonnet. 

Below are screenshots of the design, first starting with a top down view

Then a front aspect

Then a side aspect

The model is 130mm wide, 20mm tall with the inset 3mm smaller on all aspects. 

The base has a height of 1mm, the yellow "insert" is 0.5mm tall and the letters are 0.25mm tall making the entire print 1.75mm thick.
