The loco cab currently has four toggle switches they are not labelled in any way and there is nothing in the cab to provide information to the driver as to what they do. 

With this in mind, we are looking to get some toggle switch nameplates in black with the horn in red, they will look like these.

To ensure that they would fit in the cab of the loco we made up some paper templates.

All looks good, just need to wait on the vendor now to ensure that they can do the sizes we need.
