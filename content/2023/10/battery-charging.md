Today we charged the battery for the first time, we got a smart charger from Amazon

It has many modes we will never use but can deliver 2A which was the recommended charging rate from the battery manufacturer.

The battery already had some "juice" so it didn't take long to charge to full capacity.

Works pretty well but I think it will make sense in the long run to get a charging port installed on the loco itself.
