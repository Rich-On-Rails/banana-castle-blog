We have had the decals that we designed in a [previous post](/2023/10/decal-design) printed by a local company on a deep red vinyl and applied them to the body work of the locomotive.

As discussed in that post 'Howell Rail' is fictitious and the number '9' is the engine number at the club.

Here are some photos of the process of getting the decal onto the engine.
