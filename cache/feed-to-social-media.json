The cab will be a number, in this case number 9, the loco is a member of a club and that is her number there. This will be made for some form of acrylic, printed in 3D. The main body will have the naming &lsquo;Howell Rail&rsquo; this is a fictitious name made up but it looks good on the loco body.","pubDate":"Sun, 15 Oct 2023 17:30:00 +0000"}
